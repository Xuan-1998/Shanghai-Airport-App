<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Shanghai Airport App is a commercial mobile app to enhance the passenger management and travel management modulesâ€™ back-end


Here's what it is:
* Deploying and Achieving distributed architecture, load balancing and hot backup via Haproxy & XtraBackp
* Optimizing SQL query through Slow Query Log, and reducing query time by around 5 times through ElasticSearch


Of course, no one app will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this app!
